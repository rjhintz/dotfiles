# push default
# simple - in centralized workflow, work like "upstream" with an added safety
# to refuse to push if the upstream branchâ€™s name is different from the local one.
#
# When pushing to a remote that is different from the remote you normally pull from,
# work as current. This is the safest option and is suited for beginners.
#
# This mode has become the default in Git 2.0.
